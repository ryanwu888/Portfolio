        <h4 class="custom-font">Giving Back To The Community</h4>
        <p1 class="custom-font">My community in high school was where I developed my interest in engineering. Through classes like Intro to Engineering and Digital Electronics, I was able to think and act like a engineer. Over the summer, I go back to my high school, which hosts summer classes for people like me who want to learn more about engineering, and volunteer to help out those kids. I teach them the basics of engineering and the mindset in order to grow their interests and prepare them for what they need to know in the future.</p1>
        <p1 class="custom-font">In the future, I would like to give back to Texas A&M University for all it has provided to me to develop my knowledge and capabilities in engineering. I may consider becoming a <a href="https://asc.tamu.edu/tutoring" target="_blank">tutor</a> so that I can teach those who are struggling on their classes. I would also consider doing <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/student-life/eng-village/peer-tutoring.html" target="_blank">peer tutoring</a> as it is more open ended to anything a student may have, such as a quick question or two.</p1>
