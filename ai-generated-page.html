            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly advancing field with capabilities that continue to evolve. AI can perform complex tasks, analyze vast amounts of data, and make predictions. However, it has limitations. AI lacks true understanding and consciousness; it operates based on patterns and algorithms.

            Misconceptions about AI often arise from exaggerated expectations. It cannot replace human intuition, creativity, or emotional intelligence. AI systems are only as good as the data they are trained on, and biases in data can lead to biased outcomes.

            Understanding the capabilities and limitations of AI is crucial for responsible development and usage.

        <p class="prompt-text">
            Create a html page, themed using css. Write the content in html, but format it in css. There should be two files, one html and one css.
In the html page, create an information section that explains what AI can and cannot do, and any misconceptions about AI. The information should contain a link to this website. The AI generated page should contain the title "AI Generated Page" in it. This title should be at the top of the page, a bit to the left, and should be relatively big. There should be a table of contents area that contains webpages to the "Landing Area" using the link "index.html", "Technical Portfolio" using the link "technical-portfolio.html", "Qualifications Section" using the link "qualifications-section.html", "Service Section" using the link "service-section.html", "AI-Generated Page" using the link "ai-generated-page.html". The table of contents should be under the title and to the left side of the page. The theme for this page should be boxes that separate the title from the table of contents from the information about AI. Create an additional section called prompt that contains this entire paragraph of text. Do not simplify using "...", write everything out in its entirety. The Title should be in its own box, the table of contents should be in its own box, and the information section should be its own box, and the prompt should be in its own box. The information section should be under the title and to the right side of the page. The page should be monochrome.
