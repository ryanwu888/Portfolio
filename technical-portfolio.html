        <h4 class="custom-font">Past Projects</h4>
        <h5 class="custom-font">Security Alarm System</h5>
        <p1 class="custom-font">This project was done at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu" target="_blank">Texas A&M University</a>. It was really interesting and fun because I had to build the alarm using only very simple components, something I did not have a lot of experience with. Although I had built simple functions using simple components in the past, this was the first time I had to make something more complex. I used state machine methodology and the Verilog language to design the functions of the secuirty alarm. I learned to synthesize verilog to a netlist and used it to program a FPGA chip.</p1>
        <h5 class="custom-font"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot-sumo" target="_blank">Sumo Bots</a></h5>
        <p1 class="custom-font">This was a personal project done over the summer. I really wanted to build something, but I was not sure what exactly. After brainstorming, I remembered really enjoy an old TV show called BattleBots, where there would be a battle between two robots. I wanted to build something similar, and ended up coming across SumoBots. I personally researched important aspects and parts of the robot, and quickly learned random skills needed to build the robot, such as soldering. This project was completed within a week of starting. I learned the Arduing language in order to program the motion control. I also developed a location tracking system using object detection devices and speed calculations to improve the robot's capabilities.</p1>
        <h5 class="custom-font"><a href="https://ftc-events.firstinspires.org/" target="_blank">Autonomous FTC Tournament</a></h5>
        <p1 class="custom-font">This project was done with a team in robotics club. I lead the development of the robot's autonomous program that was necessary to complete a certain part of the tournament. I was able to learn how to build and connect an android app to the robot for these instructions the fastest, which is why I took lead. I learned to manage my time and fix bugss within 24 hours. We won the Design Award in the cisco FTC Tournament. We also ended up second place overall and won the control award in the Google FTC Tournament for the smartest, quickest, and most accurate automation.</p1>
