        <h4 class="custom-font">Introduction</h4>
        <p1 class="custom-font">Hello! My name is Ryan Wu, and I am majoring in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_engineering" target="_blank">Computer Engineering</a> at Texas A&M University. Back when I was deciding on what major I should choose, I could not decide between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering" target="_blank">Electrical Engineering</a> because I love doing both software and hardware. It did not feel right to let go of one of the two because I wanted to learn more about both sides. </p1>
        <p1 class="custom-font">Stuck on this decision, I was advised to take Computer Engineering because it allowed me to doing both sides. Although I was warned that this major would be harder because it consisted of the hard classes from both the Computer Science major and the Electrical Engineering major, this did not stop me from applying.</p1>
        <p1 class="custom-font">I love the whole engineering process from physically building to digitally building, so when it comes to specific interests in engineering, I cannot decide! I am interested in anything and everything engineering. Please take a look at my other pages on this website to learn more about me and what I have done!</p1>
